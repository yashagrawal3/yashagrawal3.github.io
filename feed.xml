&lt;h3 id=&quot;geotonky-activity&quot;&gt;Geotonky Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Port of this activity was done but it repository in Sugarlabs was a hostile fork, working on it resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;followme-butia&quot;&gt;Followme Butia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity is ported but do not have hardware for testing this activity, so it on a hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done-this-week&quot;&gt;Work Done This Week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Week I took a look on almost all the repositories that are in Gtk+ 2 and need a port to Gtk+ 3 and opened 16 new issues in various repositories. I also updated a repository where I keep a track of all Gtk+ 2, view updated list &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yashagrawal3/sugarlabs-porting-list&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agubrowser Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dasher Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Block Party Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Chart Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SocialCalc Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flip Sticks Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agubrowser-activity&quot;&gt;Agubrowser Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minor Fixes to complete the port of this activity to Gtk+ 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dasher-activity&quot;&gt;Dasher Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minor improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-party-activity&quot;&gt;Block Party Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ported activity to Gtk+ 3, found a great tool while working on it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/Inspector&quot;&gt;GtkIndpector&lt;/a&gt;, I suggest every GTK/Glib/Gnome enthusiast to check it out. It is meant to work like Chrome Developer tools and does it’s job very well. Faced a couple of issue and learned a lot while working on this acitivity. Adding a toolbar to this activiy was a bit of trouble becuase GtkDrawable was loosing it’s Key press event property. Quickfix for this issue issue is to change can_focus flag to True (verified using GtkInspector), but since it was originally designed to to keep away from the Sugar design, Quozl, Ibiam and I decided to keep it the way it is for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;star-chart-activity&quot;&gt;Star Chart Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeated Iterations are being made to this activity to take this to a point where it is ready for next release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;socialcalc-activity&quot;&gt;SocialCalc Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixes to complete the port of this activity to Gtk+ 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flip-sticks-activity&quot;&gt;Flip Sticks Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity was a challenging activity to work on. All it’s code was written in Drawable, so first major work to port it Cairo, being a big activity this task was big in itself. Following this was porting to Gtk+ 3. Port to Gtk+ 3 was successful but Cairo part of this code is still buggy, Quozl has guided me to complete its work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my eighth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC Blog - Week 6</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC Blog - Week 6" /><published>2018-06-18T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-06-18T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week6</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week6">&lt;p&gt;This is my seventh GSoC blog which tells work done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done-this-week&quot;&gt;Work Done This Week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Chart Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turtle Confusion Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Constellation Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turtle Flags Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;star-chart-activity&quot;&gt;Star Chart Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work on this activity has been done by this week. A lot of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw_arc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw_rectangle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw_line&lt;/code&gt; were used in this acitivty, all of them were ported to Cairo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turtle-confusion-acitivity&quot;&gt;Turtle Confusion Acitivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally all required changes were made and the pull request(with over 250 commits, not all by me though :P) was merged. The next task involving this activity would be to add its functionality to the Turltle Art Activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;star-constellation-activity&quot;&gt;Star Constellation Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has similar codebase to Star Chart, while working I found that it also required some fixing, so added a commit fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turtle-flags-activity&quot;&gt;Turtle Flags Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with previous conversation with Ibiam, where we decided to work on this activity once the Turtle Confusion’s pull request gets merged, I started my work on it following every comment I got on Turtle Confusion, so that reviewing process becomes easier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my seventh GSoC blog which tells work done this week.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC Blog - Week 5</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC Blog - Week 5" /><published>2018-06-11T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-06-11T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week5</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week5">&lt;p&gt;This is my sixth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done-this-week&quot;&gt;Work Done This Week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jigsaw Puzzle Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Chart Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AEIOU Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turtle Confusion Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Can Read Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jigsaw-puzzle-activity&quot;&gt;Jigsaw Puzzle Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a jigsaw puzzle game activity on which some work was done by Zeeshan Khan who was doing this project last year. His work was half way through and took me couple of days to fix most of the errors that were logged. Latter I came across a issue, which after a hours of searching for a fix, prooved to be a bug in Cairo drawing itself. After discussion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnome.org/BenjaminBerg&quot;&gt;Benjamin Berg&lt;/a&gt; from Gnome, who has been also been a contributor to Sugar Labs, found that only way to fix the problem is to refactor the code and avoid using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; for each Jigsaw puzzle and use instead use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gtk.Drawing&lt;/code&gt; in place of it. This will lead to losing the functionality of mouse click used to drag and drop the jigsaw puzzle. After discussion with mentors, it was decided to defer this activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;star-chart-activity&quot;&gt;Star Chart Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started my work on this activity and pushed some commits on Gtk3 branch on my fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aeiou-acitivity&quot;&gt;AEIOU Acitivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All work on this activity was completed and the pull request was merged in the master branch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turtle-confusion-activity&quot;&gt;Turtle Confusion Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this Activity still continues. I am making all changes requested by James Cameron to make this commit mergeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-can-read-activity&quot;&gt;I Can Read Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend another day on it, did get some success while fixing. Pull request is now closer to be merged.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my sixth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC Blog - Week 4</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC Blog - Week 4" /><published>2018-06-04T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-06-04T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week4</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week4">&lt;p&gt;This is my fifth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done-this-week&quot;&gt;Work Done This Week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TamTam Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Falabracman Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AEIOU Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turtle Flags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Can Read Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tamtam-activity&quot;&gt;TamTam Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity was also not in working condition. Even after spending hours on it, wasn’t able to get much ahead. After discussion with Ibiam, it was deffered to later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;falabracman-activity&quot;&gt;Falabracman Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a game activity based on olpcgames. The activity has been ported to GTK+ 3, some work on small bugs like screen resize are still left before the pull request can be merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aeiou-activity&quot;&gt;AEIOU Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these have a common error that is always logged while running this activity, this was an attempt to fix it which might help with I Can Read work. All code was refactored and error was fixed with the help of James Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turte-flags&quot;&gt;Turte Flags&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some initial code review, It was observed that this was also fork of Turtle Art and similar process that was followed in Turtle Confusion was to be done here. Since the pull request in Turtle Confusion was still getting comments and review, so I decided to wait until that PR is merged, to avoid doing same work twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-can-read-activity&quot;&gt;I Can Read Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being stuck on a bug for days, I was finally able to find a way to hack my way through it. The Activity looks in much better condition now, though many bugs still need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my fifth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC Blog - Week 3</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC Blog - Week 3" /><published>2018-05-28T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-05-28T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week3">&lt;p&gt;This is my fourth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done-this-week&quot;&gt;Work Done This Week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pyeyes Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ajedrez Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moon Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turtle Confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pyeyes-activity&quot;&gt;Pyeyes Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the remaining work in this acitivity was done and port to GTK+ 3 was completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ajedrez-activity&quot;&gt;Ajedrez Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Files of this activity was ported to GTK+ 3 in this week. Since this activity had some bugs initially in the previous version, these bugs were still present after the port. Later after discussion between James and Tony, James metioned that I should deffer work on this activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moon-activity&quot;&gt;Moon Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work on this activity was done by Ibiam already, some part of this activity is not functional. Even after hours of debugging, few bugs were still left. After discussion with Ibiam, we decided to deffer this activity to later until Ibiam is done with his tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turtle-confusion&quot;&gt;Turtle Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big activity file based on Turtle Art. It was made to make starting with Turtle Art easier for students. Initially I started working with porting a lot of files to GTK+ 3, but later after suggestion from James, I decided to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git format-patch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git am&lt;/code&gt; to bring all changes between the activities and resolve conflicts, which itself prooved to be a time taking task.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my fourth GSoC blog which tells work done this week.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC Blog - Week 2</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC Blog - Week 2" /><published>2018-05-21T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-05-21T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week2">&lt;p&gt;This is my third GSoC blog which tells work done this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done-this-week&quot;&gt;Work Done This Week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Can Read Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record Activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Know ABCs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pyeyes Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-can-read-activity&quot;&gt;I Can Read Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity was in very bad shape, GTK+ 2 version of this activity was also not in working condition. It had many files that needed work. This activity is similar to AEIOU, Lettermatch and I Know ABCs which helped me during porting it. A lot of work will also be done in following week on this activity to bring to working condition where all major issues are resolved. The activity still not functions as it is intended to and work is going on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;record-activity&quot;&gt;Record Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James has been working on it for a long time and most of the work on it was already done by him. This is a complicated activity which involved audio and video recording. To run this activity, I had to move from virtual box sugar live build, to Sugar build on ubuntu 17.10 installed on my laptop, this process made camera and microphone to be usable by the activity. On conversation with James, he asked me on continouos shot feature of it. I got confused later by his statement after reviewing to code and made a little change. Until further discussion, where he already fixed all issues and ported activity to GTK+ 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-know-abcs&quot;&gt;I Know ABCs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, this activity was similar to I Can Read Activity and others. It was relatively easier task to port this activity to GTK+ 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pyeyes-activity&quot;&gt;Pyeyes Activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a small activity with simple functions, Most of work in the GTK+ 3 port of this activity was also done in this week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my third GSoC blog which tells work done this week.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC Blog - Week 1</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC Blog - Week 1" /><published>2018-05-14T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-05-14T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-week1">&lt;p&gt;This is my second GSoC blog which focuses on the workflow involved to porting a activity to gtk+ 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the world changes, Sugar cannot stand still. If the platforms we depend upon drop support for the version tools we are using, then we have to either take over maintenance of these tools ourselves as proposed, update our work so that it remains compatible. The migration to GTK-3 is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the project description says “GTK+ 2 and GStreamer 0.10 are end of life. We need to upgrade the remaining activities with these dependencies.”, we need to upgrade the Sugar activities to maintain its support and get security update on various platforms. The movement from PyGTK to PyGObject API means no more maintenance of it. GTK+ 3 is a major new version of GTK+ that breaks both API and ABI compared to GTK+ 2, which has remained API- and ABI-stable for a long time. The main purpose of this project is to port dependencies of 25 Sugar activities from “GTK+ 2 and GStreamer 0.10” to “GTK+ 3 and GStreamer 1.0”. The task will be accompanied by updating to the latest version of sugargame and Sugar Toolkit. GTK+ 3 introduced many changes to improve UI by providing a number of new widgets, switches, toolbars etc. A lot of other changes have also been introduced, to name a few: Use of Cairo for Drawing, Use of GtkBox, Removal of HippoCanvas library and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The import of pygtk should be changed to import gi. All the codes which includes gtk should be replaced by Gtk. And there is no gtk.gdk library maintained by the developers so you should replace gtk.gdk with Gdk. All the imports should be changed from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import gtk&lt;/code&gt; to from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gi.repository import Gtk&lt;/code&gt;. All the imports from sugar should be changed to sugar3. As sugar3 toolkit is based on Gtk3 and sugar toolkit was based on gtk2 so Use sugar3 toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;– import pygtk
– pygtk.require(‘2.0‘)
– import gtk
– from sugar.graphics import style
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;should be replaced by :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ import gi
+ gi.require_version(“Gtk“, “3.0“)
+ from gi.repository import Gdk
+ from gi.repository import Gtk
+ from sugar3.graphics import style
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hbox, Vbox, pack_start, pack_end : This method pack_start, end takes 4 parameters :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;widget to pack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;padding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in pygtk it was optional to specify every parameter. If not specified default values were used. But in Gtk3 it is complusory to specify all the 4 parameters. So while porting to Gtk3 if a parameter is not specified in pygtk you can add that parameter and put the default value to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If expand was not set, use value True&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If fill was not set, use value True.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If padding was not set, use value 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example :
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;– box.pack_start(widget, True, False)&lt;/code&gt;
Should be changed to :
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+ box.pack_start(widget, expand=True, fill=False, padding=4)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great guide for porting to gtk+ 3 can be found in sugar-docs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">This is my second GSoC blog which focuses on the workflow involved to porting a activity to gtk+ 3.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GSoC’ 18 with Sugar Labs</title><link href="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-welcome" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GSoC’ 18 with Sugar Labs" /><published>2018-05-08T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-05-08T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yashagrawal3.github.io/gsoc-welcome">&lt;p&gt;Wohoo! I have been selected in Google Summer of Code 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to work with Sugar Labs this summer on ‘Say no to GTK+ 2’ project. Thanks to GSoC, Google and Sugar Labs for providing me such a great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal for the project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/gsoc_proposal.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sugar Labs® is a volunteer-driven member project of Software Freedom Conservancy, a nonprofit corporation. Originally part of the One Laptop Per Child project, Sugar Labs coordinates volunteers around the world who are passionate about providing educational opportunities to children through the Sugar Learning Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project&quot;&gt;Project:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-say-no-to-gtk-2&quot;&gt;Just say no to GTK+ 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world changes, Sugar cannot stand still. If the platforms we depend upon drop support for the version tools we are using, then we have to update our work so that it remains compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the end of GTK+ 2 and GStreamer 0.10, we need to upgrade the activities with these dependencies. The purpose of this project is to port dependencies of 25 Sugar activities to “GTK+ 3 and GStreamer 1.0”. The task is accompanied by updating to the latest version of sugargame and Sugar Toolkit. This project ensures better performance and long-term support for these sugar activities.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-done&quot;&gt;Work Done:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the early birds who started contributing in December. I had made a total of 71 commits before the submission of proposal. Here is the list of all my commits. Most of my work was based on ‘porting to GTK+ 3’ (which is also my GSoC project) and fixing bugs on Sugar Activities.
Task for Next Week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be writing a detailed workflow for porting sugar activities from GTK+2 to GTK+ 3. It will follow some trivial steps that I will follow during porting of each activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to an amazing summer. cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yash Agrawal</name></author><category term="Gsoc" /><summary type="html">Wohoo! I have been selected in Google Summer of Code 2018.</summary></entry></feed>
